# Master-Project-A-Low-Power-Low-Dropout-Regulator-LDO-for-an-Energy-Management-Unit-
The storage energy is an important parameter for autonomously operating electronic implants. An energy management unit (EMU) consisting of 4 supercapacitors for an electronic osteosynthesis implant is developed at the Institute for Integrated Circuits (IIC) at the Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH). The energy management unit consists of an inductive energy transmission, a PMOS transmission gate, a switch matrix where the connection between the supercapacitor changes from parallel to series, a digital control unit that controls the topology switch of the supercapacitors, a comparator that compares the supercapacitor voltage with a voltage reference, a timer and a counter that is used to activate the comparator. There are two LDO regulators in the EMU. The output from the switch matrix is converted to a stable 1.8V voltage by the main LDO regulator and is sent to the implant. The output from the switch matrix goes to another low-power LDO regulator that powers different circuitry of the EMU. The project work focuses on building this low-power low dropout regulator for the energy management unit. As the unit has to operate continuously, the low-power LDO regulator also has to be active continuously. Thus a lower power consumption is necessary for the regulator so that the EMU does not consume more energy than it supplies by discharging the capacitors to a lower voltage. The regulator is designed in Cadence design environment using X-Fab 180nm XH018 technology with a two-stage operational amplifier as the error amplifier, a PMOS transistor as the pass device, and a series of diode-connected PMOS transistors as the feedback network. For the frequency compensation, an internal compensation approach is followed. The results show that the LDO regulator exhibits a stable 1.8V output voltage and has a dropout voltage of 145mV. The regulator achieves a very low quiescent current of 3.2ÂµA and a power efficiency of 82.22% at maximum load current.
